          <div>
            <h5>Methods to Protect Information</h5>
            <p>Jitsi focuses on protecting data from its users, one such method revolves
              around its lack of use of cookies to identify users; using differing methods such
              as fingerprints to promote anonymity. IP addresses are not completely recorded using small
              octets so a completely accurate location will not be recorded utilizing its privacy mode.
              Geo-targeting is also another measure taken in order to comply with country policies while
              also placing restrictions on cookies and storing IP addresses. </p>

            <p>As for how this pertains towards the Animal Liberation Press Office and their workings,
              utilizing Jitsi can create a secure form of communication between party members and their
              efforts with digital security. Communication as well as personal information can stay
              privatized against any other forms of outsiders, such as unauthorized users obtaining
              private information or those working against them. </p>

            <h5>User Recognition</h5>
            <p>Events from Jitsi’s anonymous users are stored with user id with authentication. 
              The Animal Liberation Press Office has a need for this type of storage of information 
              so as to keep confidential details private to the public, as means of operation may need 
              to stay personal until actions are taken.  </p>

            <h5>Encryption</h5>
            <p>Hop-by-hop encryption is used to protect Jitsi’s video calls, making differing parts 
              encrypted as the meeting goes along. With Jitsu being an open-source project, any individual 
              can investigate the code and verify issues with the project, as well as being marketed as an 
              overall level of higher quality with lower latency for more sustainable meetings and video 
              calls. Having a proper meeting source is needed for such a group, as for information to be 
              given reasonably there has to be comfortability and easy access, which Jitsi would provide. </p>
